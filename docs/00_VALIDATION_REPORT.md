## ⚠️ **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **This WILL Work If:**

```
1. ✅ You implement ALL Priority 1 fixes
   (Use Decimal.js, add security, validation)

2. ✅ You test accounting logic extensively
   (With real data, real accountant)

3. ✅ You don't skip compliance work
   (GDPR, privacy policy, data protection)

4. ✅ You use AI systematically
   (Follow specs, test output, iterate)

5. ✅ You have a design partner
   (Real accountant to test with)

6. ✅ You're willing to iterate
   (Fix bugs, improve based on feedback)

7. ✅ You launch with beta first
   (Not straight to public)
```

### **This MIGHT Fail If:**

```
❌ You skip critical fixes
   (Especially Decimal.js for calculations)

❌ You don't validate accounting logic
   (Financial errors = legal liability)

❌ You ignore security
   (Data breach = business over)

❌ You rush to production
   (Without proper testing)

❌ You build everything at once
   (Instead of iterative development)

❌ You don't review AI output
   (Blindly trust AI generation)

❌ You skip beta testing
   (Launch to real clients untested)
```
